# Superstore Sales Analysis (Tableau) — Beginner Visualization Project

### Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Data Visualization course (CST2111)**.  
Using Tableau and the Superstore dataset, I created visualizations to answer business questions related to sales, profit, and shipping behavior.

Each question was presented on a separate worksheet following the **Shaffer 4C framework** to choose appropriate chart types.
